	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p class = "bio">Born and raised in Huntersville.  Moved 4 seperate times through my childhood and never left the same zipcdode.  College graduate of the University of North Carolina of Wilmington where I studied Criminal Justice and found a passion for web developing.  Continually learning while exploring my new backyard of Charlotte, NC</p>

	<p>I enjoy anything automobile related and addicted to coffee.  If I it is a choice between a night on the town or a night out in the woods, I would be already packing my bags before I was asked.  One day dreaming of rescuing dogs and creating a fulfilling career as a web developr. </p>
